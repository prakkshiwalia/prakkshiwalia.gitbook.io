# A/B Testing with Fake User Data (Using Lib)

What is A/B Testing?

A/B Testing (also known as split testing) is an experiment where two or more versions of a webpage, app feature, or product are compared to determine which performs better. It involves:

1. Group A (Control Group): Users who experience the original version.
2. Group B (Test/Variant Group): Users who experience the modified version.

Example:\
A product manager (PM) wants to improve user sign-ups on a website.

* Version A: The current "Sign Up" button (Control).
* Version B: A redesigned "Sign Up" button (Test).
* The group with the higher conversion rate determines the winning version.

### **When is A/B Testing Done?**

A/B testing is used in situations where **data-driven decision-making** is needed. Some key scenarios include:

| **Use Case**                | **Example**                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Website UI Optimization** | Testing different landing page designs to improve sign-ups.       |
| **App Feature Testing**     | Comparing two versions of a navigation menu for better usability. |
| **Marketing Campaigns**     | Finding the best email subject line for higher open rates.        |
| **Pricing Strategy**        | Testing different price points to maximize revenue.               |
| **User Engagement**         | Testing different notification timings for better retention.      |

### **Why is A/B Testing Useful for Product Managers (PMs)?**

Product Managers rely on A/B Testing for data-driven decision-making, helping them:

1. Make Confident Product Decisions → Instead of guessing, PMs use real user behavior.
2. Optimize User Experience (UX) → Helps PMs determine which design or feature users prefer.
3. Increase Conversion Rates → Identify the best version of sign-up flows, checkout processes, or CTAs.
4. Minimize Risk → Instead of launching major changes blindly, PMs test on a smaller audience first.
5. Support Business Goals → Aligns product improvements with company revenue and user engagement KPIs.

| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prototype Stage** (Early Testing)               | Conducted with **fake users or internal teams** before releasing to real users. | Testing two different UI designs on a **mock version** of an app.                       |
| **Beta Testing Stage** (Pre-launch)               | Done with a **small subset of real users** before full rollout.                 | Rolling out a **new pricing model** to 10% of users to see the impact.                  |
| **Post-Launch (Live Testing)**                    | Conducted on a **live product** with real users.                                | Testing a **new checkout flow** on 50% of real website visitors.                        |
| **Feature Rollout Testing**                       | Gradual release of a new feature to users, analyzing impact.                    | Releasing a **"dark mode" feature** to 5% of users, then scaling up.                    |
| **Ongoing Optimization (Continuous A/B Testing)** | Continuous testing of product changes based on **data-driven decisions**.       | Testing **different homepage headlines** every few months to optimize conversion rates. |

### **Other Common Testing Methods Used by PMs**

| **Testing Method**             | **What It Does?**                                                           | **Example Use Case**                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A/B Testing**                | Compares two versions (A & B) to find the better performer.                 | Testing different homepage layouts.                                                |
| **Multivariate Testing (MVT)** | Tests **multiple variables** at the same time.                              | Comparing 3 different CTA buttons, 2 headlines, and 2 images (more than just A/B). |
| **User Testing (Qualitative)** | Observing users interacting with a product in real-time.                    | Testing how users **navigate a new app feature**.                                  |
| **Beta Testing**               | Launching a feature to a **small group** before a full rollout.             | Testing a **new payment feature** with early adopters.                             |
| **Cohort Analysis**            | Grouping users based on behaviors and measuring their engagement over time. | Analyzing **user retention rates** for new sign-ups.                               |
| **Heatmaps & Click Tracking**  | Tracks where users **click or scroll** the most.                            | Understanding **which areas of a website** get the most attention.                 |
| **Survey & Feedback Analysis** | Collects direct user feedback for decision-making.                          | Identifying why users **churn after onboarding**.                                  |

## Objective of the project:

We'll create a **fake dataset of 20 users** participating in an **A/B test** to analyze how they interact with a product. The dataset will include user demographics and engagement metrics. Then, using **Pandas and NumPy**, we'll analyze this dataset to understand user behavior and determine if the A/B test had any significant impact.

1. **Generate fake user data (20 users)**
   * Each user will belong to **either Group A (Control) or Group B (Variant)**.
   * Data will include: **User ID, Age, Country, Session Duration, Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate, Revenue Generated, and Test Group.**
2. **Analyze the dataset using Pandas and NumPy**
   * Calculate **summary statistics** for user engagement (session duration, CTR, conversion rate).
   * Compare **Group A vs. Group B** to determine if the variant improves performance.
   * Identify **outliers** and their potential impact.
3. **Interpret Results**
   * Use statistical analysis to **conclude whether the test group (B) performed better than control (A)**.
   * Provide actionable insights based on the findings.
