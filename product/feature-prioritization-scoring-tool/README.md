# Feature Prioritization Scoring tool

The **RICE framework** is a prioritization method used by product managers to evaluate and prioritize different features, ideas, or projects. It helps in making data-driven decisions by scoring and ranking options based on specific criteria. In short, RICE helps product managers make informed and consistent decisions about what to work on next!      &#x20;

**RICE** stands for:

1. **Reach**:
   * This measures how many people a project or feature will impact within a given time period. For example, if a new feature is expected to reach 10,000 users per month, it has a high "Reach."
   * Example unit: number of users, customers, or actions in a given time frame (e.g., monthly).
2. **Impact**:
   * This estimates how much impact the feature or project will have on those users, typically on a scale from 0.25 (minimal impact) to 3 (massive impact). It’s a qualitative measure of how significant the change will be.
   * Example: If the feature boosts engagement, user retention, or revenue, the higher the impact score.
3. **Confidence**:
   * This measures how sure the team is about their estimates for Reach and Impact. Confidence is scored from 0 to 100%, where a lower confidence score means there’s more uncertainty about the expected outcome.
   * Example: If the team has high confidence due to data or past similar projects, they would give it a high score.
4. **Effort**:
   * This measures the amount of time, resources, and work required to complete the feature or project. It is usually scored in person-months, which is the number of months it would take for one person to complete the task.
   * Example: If a feature requires a lot of development time, the effort score will be high.

#### How the RICE score is calculated:

To calculate the overall RICE score, you use the formula:

RICE score= (Reach × Impact× Confidence) / Effort

The goal is to get a higher score, which means the feature or project is more valuable relative to the effort it takes to implement.

#### Example:

* **Reach**: 10,000 users per month
* **Impact**: 2 (on a scale of 0.25 to 3)
* **Confidence**: 80% (0.8)
* **Effort**: 5 person-months

RICE score= (10,000×2×0.8)/ 5= 3,200

#### Why product managers use the RICE framework:

* **Objective decision-making**: It helps product teams focus on initiatives that have the biggest impact relative to the effort required.
* **Resource allocation**: It allows product managers to allocate resources (time, effort, budget) effectively, especially when working on multiple initiatives.
* **Prioritization**: It provides a clear framework to compare different product ideas, features, or tasks, ensuring that the highest-value items are prioritized.
