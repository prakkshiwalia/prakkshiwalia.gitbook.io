# Seaborn

Seaborn is built on Matplotlib but provides more beautiful, easy-to-use and high-level visualizations. It has built-in functions to work directly with Pandas DataFrames. Seaborn makes it easier to create visually appealing charts with less code.&#x20;

1. Histogram - A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It organizes data into bins(intervals) and displays frequency (how often values occur in each bin). Histogram helps in identifying patterns, trends, and data distribution characteristics. When to use histograms?

* **Detecting trends** (e.g., Are most users clicking a few times or a lot?).
* **Understanding data distribution** (e.g., user engagement, exam scores, income levels).
* **Identifying skewness or normality** (e.g., Is the data balanced or skewed?).
* **Finding gaps and outliers** (e.g., Are there extreme values?).
